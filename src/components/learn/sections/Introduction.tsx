        <strong>QTI</strong> (Question and Test Interoperability) is a standard for defining and exchanging digital assessment content. It allows different platforms and tools to create, share, and deliver assessments in a consistent way. QTI enables you to define questions, tests, scoring rules, and metadata all within a structured format that ensures interoperability across systems.
